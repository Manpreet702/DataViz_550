    "The faceted scatter plots show a clear negative correlation between child mortality and the number of children per woman across all six years. In earlier years (1918 and 1936), most countries especially low-income ones—cluster in the region of high child mortality and large family sizes. Over time, the points shift down and to the left: child mortality declines substantially, and average family size also becomes smaller, particularly in middle and high income countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern supports what was written in the introduction of the lab. Rather than lower child mortality leading to overpopulation, the data suggest the opposite relationship: as more children survive, families tend to have fewer children. Although the plots only show correlation and not causation, the consistent downward trend over time aligns with the idea that improvements in child survival, health, and economic conditions are associated with smaller family sizes and slower population growth.\n"
