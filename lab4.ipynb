    "In this lab we will be using both R and Python,\n",

    "Although the `%%R` cell magic makes it convenient for us to do this in the same notebook,\n",

    "or RStudio to develop your R code.\n",
    "The reasons for this are that autocompletion works better there\n",
    "and the error messages are easier to understand.\n",
    "Once you have developed the code for a question\n",
    "you can paste it into the corresponding R cell here\n",
    "and make sure it runs and shows up in the exported HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your `rpy2` does not work,\n",
    "you can paste in entire cells from an R-kernel including the output plots,\n",
    "or you can submit a different notebook on GitHub for the R part,\n",
    "but you must write this in the canvas comments\n",

    "*(If you don't like the back stories, you can jump down to the heading \"The data\" Also a disclaimer that I am not a linguist, so this lab is my understanding of some articles I have read, it is likely not perfect.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I just want to thank you for bringing me back to my senses and stopping my world domination attempt and silly startup idea. I don't know what happen, but I clearly wasn't myself there for a while. Now that you have brought me back to normal, I would like design this lab more similar to the first one and go through a topic that I find intriguing and ponder-worthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time, instead of looking around us, we will look inside. Ever since I arrived on this planet, I have been fascinated about your use of airborn oscillations to transmit information generated by electrical impulses. And the fact that you rely on muscular dexterity for the encoding process as well as passive mechnotransduction for the decoding is truly remarkable (in a primitive sense of course, I guess how your kind can appreciate \"the remarkable complexity\" of a cave painting). Such a system is clearly a bottleneck in terms of information bandwidth and I am surprised a more direct means of intercranial transmission never evolved here, but from the perspective of my research on less evolved galactic lifeforms I find this fascinating!\n",
    "\n",
    "After hearing that there are over 7,000 languages spoken across this globe, I am curious whether some of these at least allow for more rapid information transmission than others. The implications of this reach beyond just communication as I have recently learned that you also restrict many of your thoughts to those that can be expressed in words (again, fascinating!). This means that you could literally upgrade your thought throughput by learning a new language. And it could mean that there are groups of people who have access to faster thinking others, just because their language can convey information at a higher rate, what an enormous advantage!"

If you want to read part of the article, I recommend that you do it after attempting to answer the questions (or if you get stuck) since it will give away some of the things that we can otherwise \"discover\" ourselves. There is also a popular science version of this article publish in The Economist, and I link to both in the optional question at the end.\n",

    "These results are looking pretty promising, now we just need to add a narrative so that it will be easy for others to follow along with what we have done here. Tell a story using the three plots we have created. Build it up according to the principles and examples from this week's required readings. In your story you can refer to the plots as plot A,B, and C. You story should make it clear what the plot is telling us and how it motivates the next plot we're making so that there is a clear story line for the reader to follow as well as a clear take home message (there might be many messages in these plots, so you can choose which to focus on). No need to write an essay here, a succinct paragraph per plot should do it.\n",

    "Plot A reveals a pattern that European languages tend to have more distinct syllables but lower information density per syllable, while many Asian languages show the opposite — fewer syllables types but higher bits packed into each syllable. This suggests a possible trade-off in how languages encode information.\n",
    "Plot B shows the other side of the trade-off. Languages with high information density per syllable tend to be spoken more slowly, while those with lower density are spoken faster. The result is a remarkably narrow range of information rates, suggesting a cognitive bottleneck in how quickly humans can process spoken language.\n",
    "Plot C confirms this pattern directly. Despite large differences in syllable structure, speech tempo, and phonology, the average information rate across languages falls within a surprisingly tight band, with most 95% confidence intervals overlapping. This supports the hypothesis of a universal rate limit in human spoken language communication.\n",
    "To conclude, across diverse languages, speakers appear to adjust speech rate to maintain a roughly constant information transmission rate, likely shaped by human auditory and cognitive processing constraints."

This could mean that certain thought patterns and emotions might be more accessible in languages where they are more easily verbalized, and maybe we would have slightly different thoughts if we knew another language (the reference here is the weak form of the Sapiro-Whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity, not the strong version). After you are done with the lab, I recommend listening to [this talk by Lera Boroditsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKK7wGAYP6k) or watching the movie \"Arrival\" (although they go a bit far...) if you are interested in learning more about this (it's fun to think about!)."
